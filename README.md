# ðŸŒ€ Quantum-Enhanced Turbulence Visualization

This project simulates 3D turbulence evolution using quantum circuits to inject complexity and variability into a synthetic fluid simulation. It integrates **Qiskit** for quantum processing and **Plotly** for interactive 3D visualization.

## ðŸ§  Overview
- Uses a parameterized quantum circuit to generate dynamic behavior.

- Visualizes a 3D synthetic turbulence field influenced by virtual pressure points.

- Evolves turbulence over time using quantum results.

- Includes interactive sliders and animation with Plotly.

---
## ðŸ§® Code Breakdown
1. turbulence_circuit(num_qubits, time_step)
- Builds a parameterized quantum circuit:

- Applies Hadamard gates to place qubits in superposition.

- Creates entanglement using CNOT gates.

- Introduces rotation (RY, RZ) and controlled-RZ gates to add complexity.

- Binds Î¸ = Ï€/4 to control quantum gate rotation.

- Returns the final quantum circuit.

2. run_quantum_circuit(qc)
- Runs the quantum circuit on the AerSimulator.

- Retrieves and returns measurement counts (bitstring probabilities).

3. generate_turbulence_field(size, pressure_points, time_step)
- Initializes a 3D cube of random values as a turbulence field.

- Adds pressure disturbances at specified (x, y, z) coordinates.

- Intensity scaled by time step.

- Returns the updated turbulence array.

4. create_interactive_visualization(...)
- Builds 3D Scatter plots using Plotly for each time step:

- Uses color and opacity to reflect turbulence intensity.

- Marks pressure points as red dots.

- Adds time animation with go.Frame() and a play/pause slider.

- Displays the animated visualization in the browser.

---

## ðŸ“Š Parameters
- num_qubits = 7: Number of qubits for quantum simulation (affects circuit complexity).

- time_steps: 10 evenly spaced values from 0.1 to 2.0.

- pressure_points: List of [x, y, z, intensity] for where and how turbulence is injected.

- turbulence_data: Stores the turbulence field per time step.

- quantum_circuits: Stores each quantum circuit for reuse/analysis.

- quantum_counts: Stores the measurement result of each quantum circuit.
